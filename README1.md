## 📋 Overview

A simple and responsive recipe page for an omelette. The page presents:

- An image of the dish
- Preparation time in a highlighted box
- Ingredients
- Instructions
- Nutritional values

The layout adapts to all screen sizes and follows the color palette and typography as described in the design brief.
